# Ball-Physics
Ball physics collision system. I'm slowly adding physics formulas to achieve a somewhat realistic collision.

This is a side project and will not be updated frequently and is merely for fun.


- gameObject.h is supossed to be a parent class for all objects to derive from but it will only be implimented when I start to use other shapes. Making it more than just a ball collision system and more of a engine.

- circle.h is gameObject but changed to allow me to quickly impliment collision for just balls. For this project, circle.h is all I will use. 

# Graphics is done by using the [olcPixelGameEngine](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcPixelGameEngine) and is not a work of my own.
